# First_Blog
I think I am spending too much time learning just concepts. So I felt the need to create something on my own.

List of the things I take into consideration:

  1. What type of atmosphere should it have? (Casual / organized / business / etc)
     As it is my pretty much first website, I want it to be simple enough. So it should be casually and simply designed, or structured.
     
  2. What features does it have?
     A. Homepage:
         There will be upper-banner with [Home, boards, favourites, inspiration, contacts]
     
     B. Boards:
         
         ------------ How it works -------------
         Get the writer's name, contact(either phone or mail), and the texts.

         After a writer finish commenting, it shows a "Thank you" message and leads back to the board page with the most recent texts shown on the top                   in the order of time.

         And there should be comments from the owner of the website.
